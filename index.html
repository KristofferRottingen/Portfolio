                            The company was started February 2020, And I based on selling self-created 
                            products to Sport-clubs in Norway. We sell products that are ment to help 
                            the clubs create a environmentally friendly club. I works as a seller

                        <h3>STUDIES</h3>
                        <p>I went to high school at Os Gymnas and are now a student at 
                            Noroff University. I am on my second, and last year before I am «graduating».
                            My Goal is to become a entrepreneur, and when we started Banefilter AS I quickly
                            found out that we were really relaying on a good website to make sales. When I 
                            saw how expansive I can be to get I website I started to experiment by my self 
                            and learned on YouTube how to make a website on Wordpress. And that’s what 
                            got me in to this study.   </p>
